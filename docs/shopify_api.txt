You can only retrieve the last 60 days worth of orders from a store by default. If you want to access older orders, then you need to request access to all orders.

For large order datasets, consider using bulk operations. Bulk operations handle pagination automatically and allow you to retrieve data asynchronously without being constrained by API rate limits. Learn more about creating orders and building order management apps.
